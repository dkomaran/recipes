# Oreo Ice Cream Cake

Use 1/2 pail of ice cream
Leave one counter until very soft.

Take 1/2 bag of cookies, put between 2 sheets of wax paper or ziplock bags and break into
small pieces with a rolling pin.

Mix crumbs with 1/4 cup of melted butter. Place into pan, then break up remaining cookies and
add them to the softened ice cream. Must be good and soft allowing cookies to be stirred in.

Place mixture into pan, then plan panner on a dinner plate and then it is into the freezer. The
dinner plate stops the mixture from leaking out.
