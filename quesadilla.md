## How to cook quesadillas
* Place the quesadilla in a dry skillet over low to medium low heat. Why no oil? Partly because this way, you don’t have to handle greasy tortillas with your hands. But more importantly, oil is a heat conductor which browns the tortillas faster than the filling heats through and the cheese melts. Tortillas are thin – and they cook fast!
* Cover with a lid – this heats the filling through and melts the cheese faster, before the tortilla gets too brown. If you don’t have a lid for your skillet, use anything that will cover it – a larger skillet, baking tray, anything. Cook until underside is golden and crispy, then remove the lid.
* Flip over the folded edge -this ensures you don’t lose any filling! Use your hand on the uncooked side to hold it together.
* Cook uncovered until crispy and cheese is molten – about 2 to 3 minutes.
* Cut in half and serve!
