# Cheesy Rotini with Garlic Butter Beef  

## Ingredients:

* 12 oz rotini pasta
* 1 lb ground beef

* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

Cook the Pasta:

Cook the Beef:
* In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Season with salt, black pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.

Make the Garlic Butter Sauce:

Combine Everything:
