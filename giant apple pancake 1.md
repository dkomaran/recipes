2 granny smith apples peeled , cored and sliced. 

1/3 cup brown sugar (packed) 

2 or 3 tablespoons of butter 

1 level teaspoon cinnamon 

4 extra large eggs 

1 level cup flour 

1 cup whole milk 

1 level teaspoon baking powder 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees 

In a 12" cast iron pan (if possible) combine apples, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon and cook over med-high heat for about 6 or 7 minutes. 

In a separate bowl, mix eggs, flour, milk and baking powder together until completely combined. ( I whip mine smooth but you're not supposed to). 

When the apples are done, remove them from the heat and pour the batter mix over the top. DON'T STIR IT IN, just let it sit on top. 

**If a cast iron pan isn't an option, throw a cake pan (non-stick is best) in the preheated oven for a few minutes with the apple mixture to allow the pan to get hot. Then add the batter to that pan** 

Place on middle rack in a preheated oven for 30-33 minutes (depending on oven). 

When time is up, remove from oven. Place a plate of sufficient size over the pan and turn the whole assembly over so that the pancake is now bottom up on the plate.
