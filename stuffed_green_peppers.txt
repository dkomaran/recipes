INGREDIENTS
•	4 large bell peppers
•	1 lb lean ground beef
•	1 (1 ounce) packet Old El Paso Taco Seasoning
•	1/2 large onion, diced
•	1 (4.5 ounce) can Old EL Paso green chiles
•	1/4 cup Old El Paso Red Enchilada Sauce, Medium
•	2 cups Mexican blend shredded cheese
INSTRUCTIONS
1.	Preheat oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with foil (we love REYNOLDS!) and set aside.
2.	In a medium skillet, heat ground beef over medium high heat, crumbling as you cook.
3.	Stir in the taco seasoning and stir until well coated. Toss in the onions and allow to cook with the beef.
4.	When beef is almost cooked through and onions begin to become transluescent, stir in the green chiles and enchilada sauce. Turn off heat. Set aside.
5.	Cut the top off each pepper and hollow out the inside; removing ribs and seeds. Place each pepper on the baking sheet.
6.	To stuff each pepper, start with several spoonfuls beef, then half cup cheese, then fill nearly to the top with beef. Top with another 1/2 cup cheese (depending on size of the pepper, 1/4 cup cheese would be enough. Whatever covers the top to your liking), and place the top back on the pepper. Repeat with remaining peppers.
7.	Bake for 30-40 minutes or until peppers are tender and cheese is melty.
8.	Serve immediately with sour cream and cilantro if desired.
9.	Enjoy!
