## Ingredients:

* 1 lb (450 g) ground beef
* 12 oz (340 g) rotini pasta
* 2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil

* 1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
* ½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 tbsp (14 g) butter
* 1 tsp Italian seasoning
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* ¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Directions:

* Cook the Pasta: Cook the rotini pasta according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.
* Cook the Ground Beef: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and break it apart as it cooks. Brown the beef for about 5-7 minutes, then drain any excess fat.
* Add Garlic: Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
