# Garlic Butter Chicken Bites with Creamy Parmesan Pasta

## Ingredients:
- 4 tbsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb chicken breast, cubed
- 8 oz pasta (penne or rotini)
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh basil, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Cook the Pasta: Boil pasta in salted water according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. Cook the Chicken: In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cubed chicken, cooking until the chicken is golden brown and fully cooked, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Make the Sauce: Reduce heat to low, then stir in heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, cooking until the sauce is creamy and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Combine and Serve: Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing to coat in the sauce. Garnish with fresh basil and serve hot.

Tips:
- Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a slight kick.
- For extra flavor, add a splash of white wine to the sauce before adding cream.
- Use fresh Parmesan for best results; it melts more smoothly into the sauce.

Notes:
* This quick and delicious meal combines tender chicken bites with a rich, garlicky Parmesan sauce. Perfect for an easy yet indulgent weeknight dinner.

Pairing:
* Serve with a side of garlic bread and a crisp Caesar salad. A glass of Chardonnay or sparkling water with lemon complements the flavors nicely.
