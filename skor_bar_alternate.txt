SKOR BAR (Alternate version)

Line cookie sheet with foil. Layer unsalted crackers or graham wafers on cookie sheet.
1/2 lb butter
1 cup brown sugar

Boil together for 3 min and pour over crackers covering completely.

Bake @ 350 F for 15 min (will be very bubbly)

While still hot, cover with 1.5 to 2 cups of chocolate chips and let set 10-15 min, then smear
the chocolate around. Place in freezer to set enough that it can be cut into pieces.
