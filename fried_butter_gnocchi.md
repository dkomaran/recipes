# FRIED BUTTER GNOCCHI WITH GARLIC & PARMESAN

- 1 1/2 lb (700g) skillet gnocchi
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (or ghee or olive oil)
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ⅓ cup Parmesan, freshly grated
- Fresh chopped basil, or parsley

## DIRECTIONS

1. To make the Fried Butter Gnocchi with Garlic & Parmesan: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium or large skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes to the skillet and heat until fragrant. Remove garlic from the skillet and set aside to avoid burning – you will add it back later. Leave the garlic-infused butter in the pan.
2. Add gnocchi to the pan (don’t clean up) and cook on high, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes. Continuously spread gnocchi evenly in the pan for crisp texture on all sides. You can add one minute for a crispier texture.
3. Add the garlic back to the pan, sprinkle half the parmesan and give a quick stir to coat well. Remove the garlic butter parmesan gnocchi from the pan and serve with remaining grated parmesan and chopped basil or parsley. Enjoy!
Note: Make sure to use skillet gnocchi, so you don’t have to boil them before cooking. All you have to do is cook them on the skillet for a few minutes. No more boiling water or draining.
